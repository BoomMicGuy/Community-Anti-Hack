# Community-Anti-Hack

The 1.14 Community Anti-Hack Datapack (CoAH for short) is an open sourced attempt to bypass the use of hacks (modded clients) by using commands to thwart them. It is not possible to prevent hacks. However it is definitely possible to detect them and run our own methods of stopping the offenders from getting away with it.

CoAH is intended for anyone to be able to use and modify at anytime! We have even included an uninstall function file to remove CoAH if anyone tries it out and does not want it.
